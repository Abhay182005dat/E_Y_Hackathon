Higher is always better!"
    },
    {
      "keywords": ["can i increase", "increase amount", "more money", "higher loan", "increase loan", "get more loan", "raise loan", "loan limit increase"],
      "answer": "Your loan amount is determined strictly by your credit profile, income, and our AI-based credit assessment — it cannot exceed your pre-approved limit. This limit is set to ensure you borrow only what is comfortably repayable. If you need a higher amount in the future, we recommend improving your credit score and reapplying after 6 months. We're always happy to reassess!"
    },
    {
      "keywords": ["why not more loan", "why low amount", "amount too low", "deserve more", "want bigger loan", "need more money"],
      "answer": "I completely understand the frustration! The pre-approved amount is calculated based on your income, existing EMIs, and credit behaviour. It is essentially the maximum safe borrowing limit our system has computed for you. Borrowing beyond it could strain your finances. Our goal is to make sure you succeed financially — not just approve loans!"

    {
      "keywords": ["reduce interest", "lower interest rate", "negotiate rate", "can i get lower rate", "reduce my rate", "lower my interest", "interest too high", "discount on interest", "interest rate reduce"],
      "answer": "Yes! You can negotiate your interest rate — but only up to a point. Our system allows a maximum of 3 rounds of negotiation, with each round reducing the rate by 0.5%. So the maximum reduction possible is 1.5% off your base rate. Once you've used all 3 rounds (or accepted the rate), it gets locked permanently in the system and cannot be changed further. Type something like 'can you reduce the rate?' to start negotiating!"
    },
    {
      "keywords": ["how many times can i negotiate", "negotiation limit", "how many rounds", "rate negotiation rounds", "how many attempts rate"],
      "answer": "You get exactly 3 negotiation rounds for your interest rate. Each round reduces the rate by 0.5%, giving you a maximum discount of 1.5%. After 3 rounds, the rate is permanently locked — no further reductions are possible. So use your rounds wisely! 😊"
    },
    {
      "keywords": ["why is interest rate high", "rate seems high", "interest too much", "rate unfair"],
      "answer": "Your interest rate is calculated based on your Approval Score (300–900 scale). A higher score means a lower rate. Factors like income stability, existing debt, and banking behaviour all influence it. The good news: you have up to 3 negotiation rounds to reduce it by 0.5% each — giving you up to a 1.5% discount. You can type 'reduce my rate' to start!"
    },
    {
      "keywords": ["can i apply for more later", "reapply later", "apply again future", "future loan increase", "loan next time"],
      "answer": "Absolutely! Once your current loan is successfully repaid (or after 6 months of on-time EMI payments), you become eligible for a fresh, potentially higher loan. Your credit profile gets re-evaluated, and with a better repayment history, you're likely to receive a higher pre-approved limit next time. We reward good repayment behaviour!"
    },
    {
      "keywords": ["emi missed", "late payment", "miss emi", "default"],
      "answer": "If you miss an EMI, a late payment penalty of 2% per month on the overdue amount applies. We recommend setting up auto-debit to avoid this. If you're facing a genuine hardship, please call us — we have restructuring options for difficult situations."
